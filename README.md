A library to connect and use BLE scales like the Acaia Lunar, Bookoo Themis mini on ESP32 Arduino.

This library is based on previous work by tatemazer (AcaiaArduinoBLE) but uses a modified version of NimBLE-Arduino instead of ArduinoBLE, which is much less prone to crashing the ESP32.

An example sketch is added.
